A small set of tools to parse the Discogs XML data dumps. Started as a couple of Ruby scripts but is moving into Scala using Apache Spark. It's very specific to my use case but could be a starting point for you.

Interesting code lives in the scala directory with the main classes being DeduplicateTracks (utility to reduce to total number of tracks based on the artists, name and remixers) and ProcessDiscogs (to parse CSV files generated by a Ruby script and extract nodes and relationships, ready to be imported to Neo4j)

Work in progress
